# lab419\_yamloid

Know enough Scala I do to yamloid parser implement like I? And can toolset supported be? Lots of questions to be answered!


Confused? Good I feel less alone now ;).

Seriously this is just my first take to takle a Scala Project and try to integrate it with the slim toolset I chose.

What it does? Well it shall parse a small (but useful to YHS) subset of YAML, hence the name.
